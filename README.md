# ðŸš¦ Road Accident Analysis with Power BI

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve road safety. 
Using **Power BI**, the data is transformed into interactive dashboards, allowing for in-depth exploration of accident hotspots, contributing factors, and time-based analysis.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis in Power BI.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizations include:
  - Accident locations mapped geographically
  - Trend analysis of accidents over time (by day, week, month, year)
  - Analysis of contributing factors such as weather, time of day, and road conditions

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation
- **Excel**: Data pre-processing and preparation
- **DAX**: Used for creating custom measures and calculations
